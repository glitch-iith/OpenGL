# OpenGL
Welcome to GLITCH's OpenGL repository!

Here you'll find tutorials and codes for mastering your graphics programming skills in opengl!

Happy Learning :)

## 1 Setting Up Your Device
Follow the below steps to make your windows machine ready for openGL programming:

1. Update your display and graphics drivers.
2. Install Visual Studio 2019 Community.
3. In VS2019, install "Desktop Development with C++" workload.
4. Download and extract [this](https://mega.nz/file/Po410awR#iJ1ITLiXjCIXJnXSPRMtWffl9uPs_5J1Amg34n2bKQ0) zip file in ```C:\```. Your directory should look like this: ```C:\Src\```.
5. Now copy the 3 files present in ```C:\Src\GLEW\bin\Release\x64``` and navigate to ```C:\Windows\System32\``` and paste.
6. You're good to go! Clone this repository to follow along.

## 2 How to Follow?

1. This tutorial is divided into multiple sections which we call projects (because this whole repository is a Visual Studio solution and each secion is a Visual Studio Project in the solution).
2. After setting up your PC, navigate through each project folder in this repository.
3. Each project has a README.md file which contains all the information about that particular project.
4. The sections are made in such a way that every section is dependent on the previous sections. So it's better to go follow the projects serially.
